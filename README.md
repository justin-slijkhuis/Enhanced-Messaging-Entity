# Enhanced Messaging Entity

This repository contains project EME.

EME is a Discord worker that lets you automate certain processes like responding to messages and changing your status. It is still a massive work in progress which hasn't reached version 1.0.0 yet.

## I am not reliable for anyone getting banned using EME.

A while ago I contacted Discord support to ask whether automated Discord actions are allowed and as a response I got: "Find out yourself, here you got some links". So I am not sure whether this does count as selfbotting which is bannable in Discord or whether you can freely use EME. So again, use this at your own risk of losing your Discord account.
